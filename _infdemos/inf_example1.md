excerpt: "Getting started with running interactive RStudio sessions on the Rhinos and Gizmos at the Hutch."

## Purpose
This demo aims to get you started on using RStudio on the HPC cluster at the Hutch.

The audience who may find this most helpful are:
- New bioinformaticians/Data Scientists at the Hutch
- Interns
- Graduate students

## Why would you want to do this?
Rstudio is a fantastic means for completing interactive computations and for data wrangling and data cleaning.  Running RStudio on the Rhinos/Gizmos (HPC cluster) is a way to get the computational power of the Rhinos/Gizmos that you need, and avoid running everything on your local workstation.  

This demo does not cover all the available options for an interactive RStudio session on the HPC, but it will get you started.

## 1) The Rstudio Server

This is the fastest and easiest way to start an RStudio session on the HPC. However, this will likely not be your primary means of running a session through the HPC.  

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to http://rstudio.fhcrc.org/
3. Enter your Hutchnet ID and password


*Pros*  | *Cons*
--|--
No setup/ installation  |  Can be laggy
SciComp precompiles most commonly used R packages | Using R version 3.3.2 (older)


## 2) On a Microsoft Windows PC

This particular example has been successful, but requires a number of prerequisites.

1. Install NoMachine on your local workstation.
