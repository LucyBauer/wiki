##Proposal Preparation and the Funding Process

The NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy (NIH GDS) has implications and requirements when preparing a proposal.  This section is aimed to provide tangible questions and answers that will facilitate proposal preparation under the NIH GDS Policy. This section includes information for proposals with human and non-human data.
Please let us know by emailing sciwiki if you notice NIH or other funding agency policy changes and we can update our site and refer content reviews to the relevant staff at our institution.

Sections Found on this page:
•	When does GDS Apply?
•	GDS Additional Requirements for Proposal Preparation Process
•	After a Proposal is Approved:  Submission of Data to NIH - De-Identification of Identified Data
•	General Application Information
•	GDS: Helpful hints for IRB application for new studies or modification on an already approved study.

Effective January 25, 2015, according the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy (GDS), all NIH-supported research that generates large-scale genomic data must be shared within an NIH trusted repository. An excellent NIH FAQ on this policy is [here.]https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/genomic-data-sharing-faqs/

## When does the GDS Policy apply to your proposal? 
  NIH-funded research that generates and/or uses human or non-human large scale genomic data, including data from microbes and microbiomes (e.g. SNP arrays, genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, transcriptomic, metagenomics, epigenomic and gene expression data, GWAS studies). 
	GDS applies to all funding mechanisms (grants and contracts) without a threshold for cost.
	Large-Scale genomic data defined [here]https://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/policies-process/nci-policies/genomic-data/about-policy; and NIH definition and examples are here.
	Studies that are not NIH-supported but plan to submit genotype/phenotype data to one of the following NIH Supported repositories:
o	Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)
o	Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
o	Sequence Read Archive (SRA)
o	Cancer Genomics Hub (CaHUB)

## When does the GDS Policy NOT apply? 
	When the genomic data is generated without NIH funds (unless the researcher voluntarily requests submission to one of NIH-supported repositories)
	When NIH-funded projects involve instrument calibration exercises, statistical or technical methods development, or the use of genomic data for control purposes, such as for assay development
	When the following funding is requested: Institutional Training Grants (T32s, T34s, T35s, and TL2s), Career Development Awards (Ks), Individual Fellowships (Fs), Resource Grants and Contracts (Ss), linked awards derived from previously reviewed applications, or facilities or coordinating centers funded through related initiatives to provide genotyping, sequencing, or other core services in support of GDS.
## GDS Additional Requirements for the Proposal Preparation Process
If GDS applies to your proposal, your proposal will require four additional items:
•	Data Sharing Plan 
•	Institutional Certification (for human subject data)
•	Proper Consent with GDS Language (for human subject data)
•	FH IRO Form “Genomic Data Sharing Supplement” (for human subject data)

## Data Sharing Plans

In general, for non-genomic data sharing, investigators seeking $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year should include a description of how final research data will be shared or explain why data sharing is not possible. These limits to do not apply to proposal with large scale genomic data and subject to NIH GDS policy. Here is an excellent [NIH Genomic Data Sharing FAQs] https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/genomic-data-sharing-faqs/

## What is in a genomic data sharing plan?
In data sharing plans within applications under NIH GDS Policy, language specific to genomic data sharing is suggested.  NIH-NIAID has [suggested language and suggestions for GDS data sharing plans]https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/gds-plan-examples. Other NIH genomic data sharing templates are [here] https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/NIH_Guidance_Developing-GDS_Plans.pdf.
Sample items for data sharing plans under GDS for all applicants proposing to generate or use large-scale genomic data:

•	description of the data type
•	intended data repository for submission – see below on what is a [Trusted Repository]  C:\Users\sgglick\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook\JNTJ1NC0\What is a Trusted Repository?.
•	data release timelines (Release timelines are discussed here, in the Supplemental Information to the National Institutes of Health Genomic Data Sharing Policy.)
•	Institutional Review Board assurance of the genomic data sharing plan
•	the appropriate uses of the data
•	if appropriate, a request for a data sharing exception, prior to award.

## What is a Trusted Repository?
The NIH GDS Policy expects genomic research data from NIH-supported studies involving human specimens as well as non-human and model organisms will be submitted to an [NIH-designated data repository or a trusted partner repository.] https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/data-repositories-and-trusted-partners/

## Is the sharing plan reviewed as part of my NIH score?
Peer reviewers will evaluate genomic data sharing plans for consistency with the GDS Policy and provide comments in their written critiques. Evaluation of the plans will not be included as part of the Overall Impact score (for grants) and will not affect scoring of the proposals on the technical evaluation criteria (for contracts), unless it is an integral part of the Funding Opportunity Announcement or Request for Proposals.

## Is the genomic data plan to be submitted to the FH IRO/IRB for approval?
Yes.  The data sharing plan is attached to the FH IRB Genomic Data Supplement Form.

## At what point in the application process is the genomic data plan to be submitted to the NIH?
Genomic data sharing plans are to be submitted as part of the initial application submission, generally in the Resource Sharing Plan section.

## Institutional Certifications (Only Human Subject Data)

In general, an Institutional Certification is a document which attests that the proposed study adheres to GDS policy. Specifically, the certification assures:
•	The submission is consistent with applicable national, tribal and state laws and regulations and institutional policies
•	Any limitations on the research use of the data, as expressed in the informed consent documents are delineated and the informed consent contains broad sharing language.
•	The identifies of research participants will not be disclosed
•	IRB has reviewed investigator’s proposal or data submission.

For NIH Submissions, it is also prudent to check GDS requirements within the specific institutes within NIH. For example, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has data sharing requirements above and beyond NIH GDS. NIAID expectations can be found [here.]https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/implementation-nih-gds-policy

## When is an Institutional Certification required?
The Institutional Certification must be completed and submitted to FH IRO/IRB for all applications falling under GDS with human genomic data, regardless if the data is identified or de-identified. 

If you are part of a multi-center project, you need to determine how the institutional certification will be completed and submitted. The primary study site may submit one Multi-Center Institutional Certification indicating that it is providing certification on behalf of all collaborating sites.  Alternatively, each site providing samples may provide their own Single-Site Institutional Certification. This should be coordinated with the primary study site or coordinating center. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: If the proposal is approved, Fred Hutch cannot issue an “Institutional Certification” unless Fred Hutch is uploading/submitting to the NIH repository the final genomic data (such as a single site study). For instance, if a Fred Hutch repository provides samples to an NIH intramural researcher for further genomic analysis, it is the NIH intramural researcher’s responsibility to complete the certifications.
IMPORTANT NTOE: The FH IRO Genomic Data Sharing Supplement is aligned with the Institutional Certificate and should only be completed when successful Fred Hutch proposals will be uploading the final genomic data to an NIH repository (e.g., dbGaP), such as a single site study.  If another institution will be doing the final upload, it is that institution’s responsibility to complete the Genomic Data Sharing analysis using its own local standards.

## There are four versions of the Institutional Certification, which one do I use?

Listed on this [NIH page]https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/institutional-certifications/ are the four different types of Institutional Certifications. There are three different versions because the form will vary according to when the data was collected.
1.  [For Studies Using Data Generated from Cell Lines Created or Clinical Specimens Collected AFTER January 25, 2015]https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/GDS_Extramural_Certification.pdf
2.	For Studies Using Data Generated from Cell Lines Created or Clinical Specimens Collected BEFORE January 25, 2015
o	[That Lack Consent]https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/GDS_Clinical_Specimen_Certification.pdf
o	[That Have Consent]https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/GDS_Clinical_Specimen_Certification.pdf
The fourth version is  Provisional Institutional Certificate to be used where the IRO has not completed its review of the protocol and therefore the institution cannot attest to all of the elements of the formal Institutional Certification.

## Selecting Public or Controlled Access Database on the Certificate
The certificate will ask if the investigator wants to submit to one of two types of repositories: 1) the open/public access database (aggregate data) or 2) controlled-access database (individual level data).  
If you select controlled-access, the certification will ask you to select if any data limitations apply. The data limitations indicated on and selected by the PI in the certificate will help dictate the access requirements to those seeking to use the data after it has been submitted to dbGaP (or another trusted database).  

## How is the certificate completed and processed at FH?
The investigator should download [FH GDS Institutional Certification Information Sheet.]https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/f/osr/genome-data-sharinggdsinsitutionalcertificationinformationsheet.html  This face sheet provides the routing flow within FH. Here is a summary of the review process from the Office of Sponsored Research.  The certificate should be signed by the investigator, then included with the protocol information submitted to the IRO for IRB review. IRO will forward the form to OSR for Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) signature after review. Once signed, OSR will return to the investigator for inclusion. If unrelated to JIT, the program will submit to NIH as appropriate; if related to JIT, Office of Sponsored Research will submit per the JIT process.

## At what point in the application process is the Institutional Certification submitted to the NIH.
The Institutional Certification, is typically provided to the funding NIH Institute or Center prior to award during the Just-in-Time process, along with any other Just in Time information. (The completed Institution Certificate should be ]uploaded in the eRA Commons Just-in-Time module.]https://era.nih.gov/commons/Commons/status/jit.htm) Whether the award you are applying for requires Just in Time should be listed the award’s FOA (Funding Opportunity Announcement). 

## NIH Just-In-Time (JIT) Information
JIT allows applicants and signing officials to submit certain elements of a competing grant application after the peer review and as the application is being considered for funding. This includes information on Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of consent (or verification of IACUC’s approval of the proposed use of live vertebrate animals, etc). Upon the return of scientific review panel percentile rankings of an NIH proposal submitted to the NIH, if the percentile rank is in the range that is potentially fundable (typically an impact score of 30 or less), investigators will receive a request for more information called the Just-In-Time (JIT) Request. To some degree, the investigator can decide, given the Institute to which they applied, their particular percentile ranking and the previous paylines of that particular Institute, whether it is beneficial to immediately follow-up action to respond to the JIT is needed or to wait. You can learn more about support for Fred Hutch investigators regarding their JIT requests and using the Hutch Grants system to manage the submission of information, including from the NIH and Department of Defense at this [Centernet site from the Office of Sponsored Projects.]https://era.nih.gov/commons/Commons/status/jit.htm

## Informed Consent
According to the GDS Policy, investigators who intend to use clinical specimens collected or cell lines created after January 25, 2015 to generate human genomic data may only do so with consent, even if the data are generated from specimens that are de-identified. NIH-designated data repositories or trusted repositories will not accept genomic data derived from specimens or cell lines collected or created after January 25, 2015 without consent.

This means to generate or use large scale genomic data collected or generated from specimens or cell lines, the IRB must assure the consent language includes language for future use and broad sharing. This includes language within a foundational (collection) consent or a study-specific consent.  

GDS Policy does not require consent to be obtained for research with data generated from de-identified clinical specimens and cell lines that were created or collected before the effective date of the Policy (January 25, 2015) because of the practical and ethical limitations in re-contacting participants to obtain new consent for existing collections and the fact that such data may have already been widely used in research.

GDS policy does allow for an exception for “compelling scientific reasons” to allow the research use of data from de-identified, clinical specimens or cell lines collected or created after the effective date of the Policy and for which research consent was not obtained. However, criteria is not clearly defined; the funding IC will determine whether the investigators’ justifications for the use of clinical specimens or cell lines for which no consent for research was obtained are acceptable.  

Guidance on Consent for Future Research Use and Broad Sharing of Human Genomic and Phenotypic Data Subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy may be found [here.] http://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/NIH_Guidance_on_Elements_of_Consent_under_th e_GDS_Policy_07-13-2015.pdf.

## Is it Human Subjects Data or Not and Why It Matters
While all large scale human genomics data under NIH GDS Policy must have a consent (or an NIH exception for data generated before January 25, 2015, as discussed above) and an Intuitional Certificate, not all data may be subject to Human Subjects Protections requirements, such as human subjects research training, or other NIH requirements.

Fred Hutch has a very helpful page here, that discusses how to [determine if your proposal falls under Human Subjects, even if the data is human data.]https://era.nih.gov/commons/Commons/status/jit.htm

NIH offers [Infopath Questionnaire]https://humansubjects.nih.gov/questionnaire to describe why your particular study may or may not  be subject to Human Subjects Protections based restrictions and reporting. However, please check with FH IRO for local policies and processes.

If the proposal includes data sourced from [one of the FH pre-approved data repositories,]https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/irb/submissionstotheirb/research-not-involving-human-subjects/_jcr_content/leftParsys/download_f2c7/file.res/Pre-Reviewed-Sources-De-identified-Human-Specimens.pdf confirm with the IRO to determine if your study still needs an appropriate consent for human data generated after January 25, 2015.  

## After a Proposal is Approved:  Submission of Data to NIH - De-Identification of Identified Data
When an application is approved, investigators should de-identify any human genomic data to be submitted to an NIH-designated data repositories according to the standards set forth in the HHS Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects (as falls under the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), to ensure that the identities of research subjects cannot be readily ascertained with the data, and should also strip the data of identifiers according to the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.]https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html 

Note, under HHS Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects, fully de-identified data is generally not considered human subjects data.  However, the GDS policy adopts this de-identification guideline for the purpose of ensuring data submitted for GDS policy is sufficient to protect the research participant, not for the purpose of rending the status of human subject data to non-human subjects data.  Under HHS Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects, coding data for de-identification requires the investigator(s) cannot readily ascertain the identity of the individual(s) to whom the coded private information or specimens pertain because, for example:

a.	the investigators and the holder of the key enter into an agreement prohibiting the release of the key to the investigators under any circumstances, until the individuals are deceased (note that the HHS regulations do not require the IRB to review and approve this agreement);
b.	there are IRB-approved written policies and operating procedures for a repository or data management center that prohibit the release of the key to the investigators under any circumstances, until the individuals are deceased; or
c.	there are other legal requirements prohibiting the release of the key to the investigators, until the individuals are deceased.

The de-identified data should be assigned random, unique codes by the investigator, and the key to other study identifiers held by the submitting institution. The key to the code will remain at the institution and will not be shared with NIH or dbGaP staff.

After approval, NIH information for dbGaP Study Registration and Data Submission to an NIH Designated Controlled-Access Data Repository can be found [here.]https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/researchers-institutional-certifications/
